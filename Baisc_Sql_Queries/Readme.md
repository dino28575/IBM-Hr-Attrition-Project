# SQL Queries

This folder contains basic SQL work done as part of the IBM HR Attrition Project.  
It includes scripts used to:
- Organize the raw HR dataset into structured tables  
- Create a basic relational data model (with *EmployeeNumber* as the primary key)  
- Improve data handling and prepare the dataset for further analysis  

These queries form the foundation for cleaning, transforming, and modeling the data in later stages of the project.
