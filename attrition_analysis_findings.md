# Findings and Key Insights

The findings and key insights from this project are as follows:

- **Work-Life Balance:**  
  Employees with a poor work-life balance are significantly more likely to leave the organization. This shows that creating flexible working hours, hybrid policies, or wellness programs can improve retention.

- **Compensation and Career Growth:**  
  Low salary bands and limited opportunities for promotion strongly correlate with higher attrition rates. Employees are more satisfied and tend to stay longer when they see clear career progression and competitive compensation.

- **Department and Job Role Trends:**  
  Some departments, particularly **Sales** and **Laboratory roles**, face higher turnover compared to others like **R&D**. This suggests department-specific challenges that may require targeted HR strategies.

- **Job Satisfaction:**  
  Employees reporting low satisfaction with their role and work environment are more prone to leave. Improving workplace culture, recognition, and engagement can directly reduce attrition.

- **Age and Experience Factor:**  
  Younger employees (early in their careers) and those with fewer years at the company are more likely to resign. This indicates that onboarding, mentorship, and career development programs are critical to retaining new talent.

### Overall Insight
The project highlights that attrition is not caused by a single factor, but by a combination of **work-life balance, pay, growth opportunities, job satisfaction, and career stage**. Addressing these areas holistically can help the organization **retain valuable talent, reduce hiring costs, and build a stronger workforce**.
